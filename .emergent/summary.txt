<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user wants to create a clone of a Tamil calendar website. The project has evolved to require:
1.  A modern, full-stack application (React/FastAPI/MongoDB) instead of a simple clone.
2.  All calendar data to be served dynamically from a database for the years 2005-2026.
3.  An admin panel to manage website data.
4.  Creation of all pages from the original reference site, including numerous special religious day pages.
5.  **Most recently**, the user has requested that the calendar data (Auspicious Times, Daily Details like Parigaram, Lagnam, Natchathiram) be corrected to match the accuracy of specific reference websites. The latest request is to use  as the source of truth and to redesign the homepage to match it.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a React frontend and FastAPI backend using MongoDB. The app features a comprehensive set of public-facing pages (~25), including a homepage, monthly calendar, and numerous special day pages. A secure admin panel allows for editing calendar data. The database is fully seeded with dynamically calculated calendar data for 8,035 days (2005-2026). The most recent work involved multiple iterative fixes to the data generation logic to improve its accuracy based on user feedback and different reference websites. Optional enhancement pages (Search, Print, Admin Analytics) have also been created but may have bugs.

**Last working item**:
-   Last item agent was working: The user requested a fix for incorrect data (, , ) and a homepage redesign, both based on a new reference website: . The agent attempted to access this website but encountered 404 Not Found errors, blocking progress.
-   Status: BLOCKED
-   Agent Testing Done: N
-   Which testing method agent to use? Web search to find the correct URL for the reference site. Once the data logic is updated, use  to test the backend API responses. For the UI redesign, use the .
-   User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   Issue 1: Data Accuracy for Parigaram, Lagnam, Natchathiram (P0)
-   Issue 2: Search Page is not rendering results (P1)

**Issues Detail**:
-   **Issue 1: Data Accuracy for Parigaram, Lagnam, Natchathiram**
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent has repeatedly modified the data generation logic in  to match patterns from two previous reference sites. While some fields (Soolam, Nalla Neram) were corrected, core astronomical data like Lagnam, Natchathiram (Star), and Parigaram remain inaccurate according to the user. The latest attempt to use the user-provided reference site  failed due to 404 errors.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Use the  to find the correct, working URL for the daily calendar on . The current links are broken.
        2.  If the site cannot be accessed, inform the user, explain the situation, and ask for a valid link or permission to use the previous reference ().
        3.  Once a valid source is available, scrape data for several sample dates to understand the correct patterns for , , and .
        4.  Update the data calculation functions in  with the new, accurate logic.
        5.  Re-run the database seeding process via the  endpoint.
        6.  Verify the fix by checking multiple random dates against the reference site.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is the user's top priority. The application's core value depends on providing accurate calendar data.
    -   **Status**: BLOCKED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both.
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: No.

-   **Issue 2: Search Page is not rendering results**
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent identified that the backend search API works correctly, but the frontend component at  fails to render the results. The agent confirmed the API call was not being triggered on button click and that the page was loading correctly, but debugging was paused to address the higher-priority data accuracy issue.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Examine  to trace the state flow from user input to the  function.
        2.  Verify the  handler is correctly bound and that React state () is updated properly.
        3.  Add  statements within the  function to confirm it's being triggered and the  call is being made.
        4.  Inspect the  state and the conditional rendering logic to ensure the component displays the data once it's fetched.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This will complete one of the optional enhancement features requested by the user.
    -   **Status**: NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend.
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: No.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Redesign Home Page**
    -   **Where to resume**: The agent needs to find the daily calendar view on the reference website  to use as a design reference. The homepage it scraped was just a landing page.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** The application's homepage will match the user's desired design.
    -   **Status**: BLOCKED
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend.
    -   **Blocked on something**: Issue 1 (finding the correct URL on the reference site).

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
**Future Tasks (P2 - Optional Enhancements):**
1.  **Enhanced User Features:**
    -   Add a Print/Download Calendar feature (placeholder page exists).
    -   Create a notifications/reminders settings page.
    -   Implement a user favorites/bookmarks page.
2.  **Enhanced Admin Features:**

-   **New Enhancement Pages**: Created placeholder pages and routes for Search, Print, Admin Analytics, and a Special Days Editor.
-   **Core Data Accuracy Fixes**: Performed multiple, extensive revisions of the data generation logic in  based on user feedback. Corrected calculations for Tamil Date, Soolam, Raahu Kaalam, Nalla Neram, and other fields. Re-seeded the entire 2005-2026 database multiple times with the improved data.
-   **Admin Panel Enhancements**: Added backend routes and frontend dashboard links for the new Special Days Editor and Analytics pages.
-   **UI Links**: Added Search and Print links to the main site navigation header.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   The Search Page bug (Issue #2 in the list above) was discovered during testing and was not fixed.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend**: React, React Router, Axios, TailwindCSS, Shadcn components.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, Pydantic.
-   **Database**: MongoDB with Motor (async driver).
-   **Data Generation**: Complex calendar data is dynamically calculated and seeded into the DB using Python logic in . This has been the main source of issues.
-   **Authentication**: JWT for admin panel.

**key DB schema**
-   **daily_calendars**: 
-   **admin_users**: 

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files of reference**
-   : **Most important file**. Contains all the complex and frequently modified data calculation and seeding logic.
-   : Defines all frontend routes.
-   : Buggy search component.
-   : The page to be redesigned.
-   : Admin panel logic, including credentials.

**Areas that need refactoring**
-   The special day pages (now over 10) share identical boilerplate for fetching and displaying date lists. They should be consolidated into a single reusable component.
-    has grown very large and complex. The calculation functions could be moved to a separate  or  directory to improve modularity.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Fetches corrected daily data.
-   : Re-seeds the entire database with the latest calculation logic.
-   : Endpoint for the buggy search page.
-   : Admin login.
-   : For the special days editor.
-   : For the analytics page.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **The primary blocker is the inaccessible reference website**: . You must resolve this before proceeding with the user's latest request. Use web search or communicate the issue to the user.
-   **Data accuracy is paramount**: The user is very sensitive to discrepancies between the app's data and reference calendars. All data logic resides in . Do not assume the current calculations are correct; they are the result of many failed attempts.
-   **The admin password is **, not  as stated in a previous handoff.
-   The Search page at  is known to be buggy.
