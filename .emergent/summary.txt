<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user wants to create a clone of the PHP website .
The project evolved through several requests:
1.  Create a pixel-perfect clone of the website.
2.  Redesign the clone to have a modern, colorful, and user-friendly interface.
3.  Make the application full-stack, with all data served dynamically from a database instead of being mocked.
4.  Clone all pages from the original website.
5.  Ensure calendar data (Auspicious Times, Inauspicious Times, Daily Details) is fetched dynamically from the database for all dates and years from 2005 to 2026.
6.  Fix the Subakariyam section to show more than two rotating messages.
7.  Create an admin panel to update all details in the database.
8.  Create all remaining pages, including special religious days and other potential pages/enhancements.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a modern React frontend and a FastAPI backend connected to a MongoDB database. The application is a redesigned version of the Tamil Daily Calendar website. It features 19 created pages (16 public, 3 admin). The database has been seeded with dynamically calculated calendar data for all days from 2005 to 2026. A functional admin panel with login, dashboard, and a calendar editor has been implemented to manage the calendar data.

**Last working item**:
-   Last item agent was working: The user requested the creation of all remaining pages (special religious days like Karinal) and optional enhancements (like search, print features, and more admin tools). The agent acknowledged the request and was about to start the implementation.
-   Status: NOT STARTED
-   Agent Testing Done: N
-   Which testing method agent to use? Frontend testing agent should be used to verify the new pages and routes after they are created.
-   User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending issues or bugs. The current work is focused on new feature development.

**In progress Task List**:
-   Task 1: Create all remaining pages and optional enhancements. (P0)

    -   Where to resume: Begin by creating the frontend page components for the remaining special religious days. Then, implement the optional enhancements.
    -   What will be achieved with this? This will complete the feature set of the website, bringing it to full parity with the original site and adding new, user-requested features.
    -   Status: NOT STARTED
    -   Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Both. New frontend pages will require UI/UX testing, and any new backend endpoints for enhancements will need API testing.
    -   Blocked on something: No.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. All identified issues have been addressed.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend**: React, React Router, Axios, TailwindCSS, Shadcn components.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, Pydantic.
-   **Database**: MongoDB with Motor (async driver).
-   **Architecture**: Full-stack with REST API communication.
-   **Authentication**: JWT-based token authentication for the admin panel.
-   **Deployment**: Environment variables used for configuration ().

**key DB schema**
-   **daily_calendars**: 
-   **admin_users**:  (Implicit schema in )

**changes in tech stack**
None. The project has consistently used the React, FastAPI, and MongoDB stack.

**All files of reference**
-   : Contains all the routes for the 19+ pages.
-   : Main FastAPI application file, which imports all the route modules.
-   : Contains the logic for dynamically calculating and seeding calendar data for all years (2005-2026).
-   : Defines the admin authentication and CRUD endpoints.
-   : Directory containing all frontend components for the admin panel.
-   : Directory containing all 16 public-facing page components.
-   : Manages admin authentication state on the frontend.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The special day pages (, , etc.) and the upcoming ones likely share a lot of boilerplate code for fetching and displaying lists of dates. This could be refactored into a reusable  component that accepts props for the title and data type.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Fetches daily calendar details.
-   : Fetches a list of dates for a given special day type (e.g., 'pournami').
-   : Seeds the database with data for all years from 2005 to 2026.
-   : Authenticates an admin user and returns a JWT token.
-   : Retrieves calendar entries for editing (protected).
-   : Updates a calendar entry (protected).

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The database is fully seeded with calendar data from 2005-2026. Do not re-seed unless the calculation logic in  is changed.
-   The user has requested the creation of all remaining pages and optional enhancements. The highest priority is to create the remaining special days pages.
-   The admin panel is located at . Hardcoded credentials in  are  and .
